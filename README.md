CrmUp
=====

CrmUp is a .NET library that helps you to deploy changes to Microsoft Dynamics Crm. This project is heavily inspired by DbUp. It tracks which Crm Solution Files have been applied already, and applies only the changes that are needed to get your Microsoft Dyanmics CRM Organisation up to date.
